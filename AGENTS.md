## Instructions

After working on a file run:

bun typecheck <file>
```

DO NOT run the tests (or other various commands) **unless** instructed otherwise

## Frontend Type-Safety Constraints

- **NEVER** use an `eslint-disable` comment (if you see one, **remove** it)

## Code quality

- Ensure that a high level of code quality is enforced.
- DO **NOT** take shortcuts of any kind
