# JSRust Plans

This directory is organized into three tracks:

- `old/`: archived historical plans and prior status/index documents.
- `future/`: future-looking initiatives that are not immediate implementation work.
- `active/`: currently relevant planning tracks (immediate and long-term execution planning).

## Current Plan Files

- `active/01-prepare-backend.md`: immediate prep work to stabilize handoff to a backend submodule.
- `active/02-compiler-progress.md`: long-term progress vs. remaining work for a functioning Rust compiler.
- `active/03-new-backend.md`: active C backend initiative and backend-oriented repository overview.
- `future/01-node-addon-availability.md`: deferred compiler availability track for a Node addon surface.
- `STATUS.md`: status tracker for the new active/future plan set.

## Archived Plans

All previous plan artifacts are in `old/`.
